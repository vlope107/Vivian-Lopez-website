        <p class="lead mb-4"><br> The IFSW Manual Human Rights and Social Work (1992) explains that: Social work originates variously from humanitarian and democratic ideals. Social work practice has, since its beginning, been focused on meeting human needs and on developing human potential and resources. Social work is about change: in the individual; in family and group living; in policies and services; and in laws and social attitudes. Social work is not simply direct work with the individual. It also involves services and action for groups and communities, with the aim of enhancing the quality of life of all citizens, including children and young people. Social workers operate in diverse cultures and contexts with varied geographical, political, socio-economic, cultural and spiritual issues. Social workers serve human development through adherence to the following basic principles: i) Every human being has a unique value, which justifies moral consideration for that person. ii) Each individual has the right to self-fulfilment, to the extent that it does not encroach upon the same right of others, and has an obligation to contribute to the well being of society. iii) Each society regardless of its form should function to provide the maximum benefits for all its members. iv) Social workers have a commitment to principles of social justice. v) Social workers have the responsibility to devote objective and disciplined knowledge and skill to work with individuals, groups, communities and societies in their development and resolution of personal-societal conflicts and their consequences. vi) Social workers are expected to provide the best possible assistance without discrimination on the basis of gender, age, disability, colour, social class, race, religion, language, political beliefs, or sexual orientation. 
It is essential that social workers have an awareness of their duties and responsibilities. They need to make sure that children and young people are fully informed of the potential consequences and risks in speaking out. At times social workers may need to act on children’s and young people’s behalf because there are too many dangers in individuals taking action for themselves. But most of the time they will join forces with their young clients to try to effect positive and lasting changes.Social workers need to consider whether the age of criminal responsibility is set at appropriate levels. In some countries the trend to increase the age of criminal responsibility has now been reversed with the age being lowered. The best interests of the child should be the paramount consideration, with social workers guarding against the tendency to ‘demonise’ young offenders. The crucial consideration is how to develop juvenile justice systems that positively support children and young people to address and change their offending behaviour, while also meeting their educational and other needs. It is important that separate court structures and legal protection exist for children. Systems must be completely designed to take into account the special vulnerability and developmental needs of children and young people. Children and young people must be meaningfully engaged in the process; proceedings should be explained to them in a way they would understand. Social workers need to be vigilant to ensure that systems are not abusing the child.
<br>

       <br> Social work is a dynamic and demanding profession that requires a variety of skills and qualities. Whether these skills are innate or acquired, success in the field requires social workers to continually develop them throughout their career. These skills include, empathy, communication, organization, critical thinking, active listening, self care, cultural competence, patience, professional commitment, and advocacy.
A social worker’s responsibilities include identifying individuals in need, help people of all stages in life to cope with difficult situations, advocate for and actually develop a plan that will help a person’s well-being. A social worker should be able to refer the best community resources for a clients. Its important to be able to respond quickly when a client’s going through a emergency crisis.  Not only should a social worker help individuals but also work with families or groups in need of assistance.

Possessing a passion for helping others as I have first-hand experience with childhood trauma and professional assistance, I was motivated to do the same for others. As a family, child, and school social worker, I get to provide social assistance to improve the social and psychological state of children and families. The services are provided in efforts to improve the family’s well being and the children’s academic success. Another part of my job requires assisting parents, arranging adoptions, and finding foster homes for abused and neglected children. In regards to schools, I address problems as teenage pregnancy, misbehavior and truancy- students who are absent for no good reason. School social workers work with teachers, parents, and school administrators to develop plans and strategies to improve students’ academic performance and social development. Students and their families are often referred to social workers to deal with problems such as aggressive behavior, bullying, or frequent absences from schoolThese are prevalent problems in lower income communities which is why they benefit a lot from professional assistance in order to live their day-to-day lives. With arising psychological stressors, it is significant to address these issues adequately. Ultimately my job is to help individuals cope with challenges and raise awareness for those who cannot do so for themselves.
 I worked at a high school for a while counseling students from a low-income community. They suffered from significant problems such as mental health issues such as depression accompanying anxiety. A lot of students have very impactful and damaging familial problems. These things can hinder their ability to learn or focus. From parents getting divorced to substance abuse in the home, the youth is greatly affected. A lot of the times when there is physical abuse in a student’s home, it is to be investigated and therefore other options are put on the table. These options including foster care system, custody battles and etc. 
It is important that there are a lot of social workers available, especially in communities with low-income families. There aren’t a lot of resources available to begin so it is important that there are social workers that are able to provide as much support as possible in schools or wherever.<br>

        
<br> There is a lot of misinformation when it comes to what a social worker can and can not do. If social services believe that there is reasonable for suspection of a child’s safety or well-being, they will write an in-depth assessment of the children’s life at home and how they are cared for. If they find it is severe and further action is needed, they will start proceedings. 
Care proceedings can take up to 26 weeks and involve multiple hearings where social services must provide their findings of their in-depth assessment and recommendations on what should happen to the child to the court. The court will then decide if the child can remain with the parents, or if they are to be placed in foster care. If a social worker decides that the child should be taken immediately from their parents, they will order an emergency protection order. Under Section 44 of the Children Act 1989 an Emergency Protection Order can be granted for up to 8 days, with a potential to be further extended for 7 more days.
In most cases you would get 1-day notice of the application for an emergency order. However, where there it is believed that the child could be significantly harmed during this time no notice may be given because there is emergency action take for the protection of the child. A parent is entitled to seek legal advice and representation during any point in these proceedings, and may be able to request Legal Aid regardless of your means.
Under Section 38 of the Children Act 1989, it states that if it can be reasonably believed that the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering significant harm an application for an Interim Care Order can be made. This Order will last until the final hearing of the care proceedings is concluded, providing protection to children while investigations and proceedings are ongoing. Under Section 46 of the Children Act 1989 the police can remove a child from their home for a period of up to 72 hours under a Police Protection Order. If they suspect that a threat to the child remains and that returning the child home to the parents would be a risk to the child’s safety and wellbeing, an application for an Interim Care Order or Emergency Protection Order will be made. When a protection order is granted, social services may be given permission to enter the parent or caregiver’s home to search and remove the child. Even if they may disagree, it is always important that they comply with court orders and that allow social services to take action where they have been granted permission to do so.Social services cannot remove your child from the parent or guardians’ home if they do not have an order by the court, their consent, or a Police Protection Order. Social services cannot decide what will happen to your child or place your child in permanent foster care without a court’s decision.<br>
